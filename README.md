Version 1.2:
- Various Changes made to Nodes including
  - Node Type added. Nodes can now be active with arrows or inactive like instruments.
  - There are 10 colours to choose from in the colour palette
  - The node radius can be set noting that this only increases the size of the node not its capacity
  - The node gain can now be set.  Gain is the ratio of the output signal from a node to its input signal when prodded by a signal.
  - The node quantum can now be set. Quantum is the size of the signal emitted from an active node when the arrows are pressed.
- Various Changes made to Edges including
  - Signal Attenuation added. How much should a signal deteriorate as it passes along an edge.  The actual attenuation happens at the mid point.
  - Signal Speed added. The speed of the signal along the edge can now be controlled as a percentage of normal speed as well as by using longer edges.
- General Changes
  - The serialise and deserialise functions have been modified to take into account the new node and edge properties (these functions are in js/model.js).
  - Simulation Settings have been added to the Serialise and Deserialise functions. This includes a maximum signal age setting by default set to 5.  That is a signal will not propagate along more than 5 edges.  This is changed at the top of js/model.js or through the data query string.

Version 1.1:    
- node amounts are now "uncapped"    
- better distribution of "signals"

Version 1.0: the whole everything.
